                <h2>The story</h2>
                <p>This is but one of the legends of which the people speak...
                    Long ago, there existed a kingdom where a golden power
                    lay hidden. It was a prosperous land blessed with green
                    forests, tall mountains, and peace. But one day, a
                    man of great evil found the golden power and took it
                    for himself. With its strength at his command, he spread
                    darkness across the kingdom. But then, when all hope
                    had died, and the hour of doom seemed at hand... ...a
                    young boy clothed in green appeared as if from nowhere.
                    Wielding the blade of evil 's bane, he sealed the dark
                    one away and gave the land light. This boy, who traveled
                    through time to save the land, was known as the Hero
                    of Time. The boy's tale was passed down through generations
                    until it became legend... But then, a day came when
                    a fell wind began to blow across the kingdom. The great
                    evil that all thought had been forever sealed away
                    by the hero once again crept forth from the depths
                    of the earth, eager to resume its dark designs. The
                    people believed that the Hero of Time would again come
                    to save them... But the hero did not appear. Faced
                    by an onslaught of evil, the people could do nothing
                    but appeal to the Gods. In their last hour, as doom
                    drew nigh, they left their future in the hands of fate.
                    What became of that kingdom? None remain who know.
                    The memory of the kingdom vanished, but its legend
                    survived on the wind 's breath. On a certain island,
                    it became customary to garb boys in green when they
                    came of age. Clothed in the green of fields, they aspired
                    to find heroic blades and cast down evil. The elders
                    wished only for the youths to know courage like the
                    hero of legend.</p>
